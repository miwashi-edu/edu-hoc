# withTransientStorage

## Transient

**Transient** is the opposite of **persistent**, something that passes, and in this case it doesn't hold state over
a refresh of the browser. It is a Component usable for tests.

It is a **HOC**, a *Higher Order Component*, it has no view, only function, and enhances the Component it uses with transient
storage.

## Usage

```js
//index.js
import withTransientStorage from './withTransientStorage';
import TodoList from './TodoList';


export const TransientTodoList = withTransientStorage(TodoList);
```
